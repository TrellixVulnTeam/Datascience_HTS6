    "We briefly touched on multiple linear regression in the Linear Regression Concepts lesson…let’s dive in deeper and learn how to implement it!\n",
    "\n",
    "A multiple linear regression is simply a linear regression that involves more than one predictor variable. It is represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Y = \\alpha + \\beta_1*X_1  + \\beta_2*X_2 + \\dots  + \\beta_p*X_p$  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each *β<sub>i</sub>* will be estimated using the least sum of squares method.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, values of the RSE generally decrease as we add variables that are significant predictors of the output variable – hence, using more variables can increase the efficiency of a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it also increases the complexity of model building since process of selecting variables to be kept and discarded can become tedious.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this simple dataset of three predictor variables, there can be seven possible models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sales ~ TV\n",
    "2. Sales ~ Newspaper\n",
    "3. Sales ~ Radio\n",
    "4. Sales ~ TV + Radio\n",
    "5. Sales ~ TV + Newspaper\n",
    "6. Sales ~ Newspaper + Radio\n",
    "7. Sales ~ TV + Radio + Newspaper\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, if there are p possible predictor variables, there can be *(2<sup>p</sup> - 1)* possible models – this can get large very quickly!\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, there are a few guidelines to filter some of these and then navigate towards the most efficient one.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keep variables with low p-values and eliminate ones with high p-values\n",
    "- Keep variables that increase the value of **adjusted-*R<sup>2</sup>*** – this penalizes the model for adding insignificant variables and increases when we add significant variables. It is calculated by: ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbar%7BR%7D%5E2%20%3D%201%20-%20%281-R%5E2%29%5Cfrac%7Bn-1%7D%7Bn-p-1%7D)\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these guidelines, there are two approaches to select the predictor variables in the final model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Forward selection**: start with a null model (no predictors), then add predictors one by one. If the p-value for the variable is small enough and the value of the adjusted-*R<sup>2</sup>* goes up, the predictor is included in the model. Otherwise, it is not included.\n",
    "- **Backward selection**: starts with a model that has all the possible predictors and discard some of them. If the p-value of a predictor variable is large and adjusted-*R<sup>2</sup>* is lower when removed, it is discarded from the model. Otherwise, it remains a part of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many statistical programs give us an option to select from these approaches while implementing multiple linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, let’s manually add a few variables and see how it changes the model parameters and efficacy. First, add the `newspaper` variable to the model:"
